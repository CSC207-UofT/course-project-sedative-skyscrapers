The moment the program is run, the user is presented with prompts in the command line to enter their account details (for now any string works to login or create an account), after completing that step, the user is then presented with a set of prompts to get the user to create/join raffles depending on the state of the program.

Upon choosing the option to create a raffle as an organizer (answering "Y"), the user will be presented with the ability to create the raffle according to their specification, and after that, even modify certain aspects of their raffles, including modifying the tasks that participants in the raffle will be presented with. After the creation of a raffle, the user will be shown all of the information now stored in the raffle.

Next, upon choosing the option to join a raffle as a participant by entering a raffle's id (shown after creating a raffle above), the user will be shown some details of the raffle, and the tasks set up by the raffle organizer for them to complete, which can be accessed and completed according to command line instructions (which makes the user a valid participant).

Note: in this walkthrough that we have set ourselves to complete for phase0, many features that we want to include have been scaled down or not implemented because of how a single user is in charge of operating the command line, so for example, such user is allowed to both organize and participate in the same raffle object, which would not be proper behavior in the finished result.
