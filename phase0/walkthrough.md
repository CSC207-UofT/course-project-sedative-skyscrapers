The moment the program is run, the user is presented with prompts in the command line to enter their account details (for now any two strings work to login or create an account), after completing that step, the user is then presented with the MainPage, where they can create (take on organizer status) or sign up to a giveaway/raffle (as a participant) by using a raffle's ID, within this raffle's page.

Upon choosing the option to join a raffle as a participant and entering a raffle's code (for now any code works), the user will be shown all of the tasks set up by the raffle organizer for them to complete, which can be accessed through the enterTask(<taskName>) method, which will output the details to complete such task to the user; the user can then enter the answer to the tasks' questions and check for correctness in order to get an entry into the Raffle (which confirms participation in such raffle), entering the user into the random draw to win the raffle's prize.

Alternatively, upon choosing the option to create a raffle as an organizer, the user will be presented with the ability to modify their raffle as they wish, including modifying the tasks that participants in the raffle will be presented with, modifying the time left until participants can no longer complete tasks to gain entries to participate in the raffle, and generating the results of the raffle (randomly selecting a winner/s).

Note: at phase0, some of the features of the account system and the raffle system won't be fully functional, since things such as account registration or raffle creation (online) depend on setting up the database for the project, which we'll get to later on, so for any section of the walktrough that specifies it will work with any input of strings for these cases.
