Domain: Giveaway application

Brief Description:
Online raffle platform allowing for brands (Organizers) to start up raffles to have a set of users (Participants) complete certain actions (Tasks) to have a chance to be entered as valid participants of such raffle, which in the future (phase1), would allow for these valid participants to win such raffle.

Main Features of the program for phase0:
- Interactive command line prompting the user to answer a series of [Y/N] questions and enter input as asked by prompts to create the needed objects to simulate the creation and joining of a giveaway (raffle).
- Login for users and organizers (same login for all users for now).
- Create and setup a raffle and its details, and add tasks for participants to complete (for Organizers).
- Join a raffle and complete a task as setup by the raffle organizer (for participant). 

*Note on "tasks" completed by users: as of this stage, the tasks will consist of simple String questions which must be given a simple "String" answer, this is one of the main points of expansion in the future.
